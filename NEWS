Arrow 0.1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-4-30

The initial release of Arrow. A highly experimental release, and ideally not
the version the public will see.

Arrow 0.2.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-2

A minor release, mostly housekeeping and repaying technical debt.

Bug-Fixes:

* the xAsComplex, xAsInteger... family of functions now support conversion
of lists that contain NA values of any mode, at the cost of some performance.

* xLambda now checks that ':' is used as a parametre delimiter;
previously several infix functions could be used.

Documentation:

* type signatures added to several more function's documentation.

Package Internals:

* internal function `MakeVariadic` used to generate variadic forms of
functions, which should help avoid bugs in their definitions.

* eliminated most error-message functions, in favour of in-place
definitions and macros. This removed a lot of unneeded code.

* internal function `unit_to_value` now supports complex values.

Arrow 0.3.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:

Bug-Fixes:

* Fixed corner-case for xOneOf; if given a length one vector it extracts the value
from its collection (if it is a list).

Documentation:

* Added over 40 more type signatures to documentation.
