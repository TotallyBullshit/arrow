Arrow 0.4.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-4

This version adds xNone and a logo, and fixes an important bug in error-reporting
functions (no irony whatsoever).

Enhancements:

* Added xNone; the antonym of xAll. It completes the set of functions
xAll (does every element match a predicate?), xAny (does any element match a predicate?)
and now xNone (does no value match a predicate?).

Bug-Fixes:

* Fixed an issue in reporting of missing arguments (and possibly other exceptions). The
name of the argument for which an error is thrown is now displayed properly.

Documentation:

* Added a prototype logo for Arrow!
* Added details section to xMap, explaining the basic concept of map.
* Added details section to xVersion, explaining the semantic versioning standard.
* Added example for xLastOf.

Package Internals:

* Fixed broken link tags in header of staticdocs head file.
* Added contact page (though jQuery) to staticdocs site.
* dQuote now lazily captures its argument.
* added tests for xNone.

Arrow 0.3.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-3

A bug-fix release.

Enhancements:

* Very slightly improved xProdSetOf's efficiency by changing an inner Map
to lapply.

Bug-Fixes:

* Fixed a bug in as_method, in which variadic methods were not being generated
due to the use of an outdated regular expression to test whether the input function
was variadic.

* Type-errors in functions that take collections (xExplode for example) now report
the user-facing function they were thrown from.

* Fixed corner-case for xOneOf; if given a length one vector it extracts the value
from its collection (if it is a list).

Documentation:

* Added most missing type signatures to function docs.
* Added several missing titles to function docs.

Package Internals:

* as_atom and as_typed_vector now use the parent call
(sys.call(-1)) in error reports.

* Added test to check that every function has a type signature and title.

Arrow 0.2.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-2

A minor release, mostly housekeeping and repaying technical debt.

Bug-Fixes:

* the xAsComplex, xAsInteger... family of functions now support conversion
of lists that contain NA values of any mode, at the cost of some performance.

* xLambda now checks that ':' is used as a parametre delimiter;
previously several infix functions could be used.

Documentation:

* type signatures added to several more function's documentation.

Package Internals:

* internal function `MakeVariadic` used to generate variadic forms of
functions, which should help avoid bugs in their definitions.

* eliminated most error-message functions, in favour of in-place
definitions and macros. This removed a lot of unneeded code.

* internal function `unit_to_value` now supports complex values.

Arrow 0.1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-4-30

The initial release of Arrow. A highly experimental release, and ideally not
the version the public will see.
