Arrow v0.1
-----------------------------------

### Generic & Idiomatic
  
Arrow embrace R's better quirks - such as three-value logic and vectorisation - while . 

### Cascading Style

In this style data is fed into the type constructor ```x_```, and methods are called off that object. This small program gets every parametre used in the R base library.

```javascript
x_(ls("package:base"))$  
xMap(function (x) get(x))$
xSelect(is.function)$
xMap(xParametres)$
xReducel(union)$
x()
```
The final method - ```x()``` - takes the data out the object constructed by ```x_()``` 
for normal R functions to operate on.
