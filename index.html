<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: Arrow is in heavy development and is highly liable to change.</strong></p>

<p>Arrow is a toolset of more than one hundred functions from languages
like Haskell, JavaScript, and functions designed just for R. These
include familiar functions like Map, Select, Reduce and Compose, as
well as many functions for working with na values, reshaping collections,
composing functions and manipulating strings.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy using Arrow as much as I've enjoyed making it. To
contribute with feedback, bug-reports or code go to the Arrow
<a href="https://github.com/rgrannell1/arrow">github repository</a>. Any feedback is
appreciated.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Programs are built in a lego-like manner; stacking small,
uniquely-purposed functions into a larger program.</p></li>
<li><p>Like Ruby and JavaScript, Arrow has a shorthand syntax
for creating functions to R.</p></li>
<li><p>Arrow implements jQuery-like chaining methods without using R's bulkier
object-orientation systems. These methods are just as usable as those in
Python or JavaScript. This syntax is handy for interactive programming.</p></li>
<li><p>Arrow uses consistent naming conventions to make its functions more predictable.</p></li>
<li><p>Almost every function has a variadic and non-variadic form, to
reduce boilerplate code.</p></li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="arrow-is-consistent" class="anchor" href="#arrow-is-consistent"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Arrow is Consistent</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Functions don't discriminate between different types of vectors; lists, pairlists
and typed vectors are all interchangable.</p></li>
<li><p>Extensive effort was made to make sure that Arrow never throws
a cryptic error - arguments are always explicitly checked, and the precise
cause of the error is always given.</p></li>
<li><p>Arrow is interoperable with base R functions.</p></li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="arrow-is-functional" class="anchor" href="#arrow-is-functional"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Arrow is Functional</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Arrow implements all the standard higher-order functions,
as well as dozens of collection-reshaping functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Several variants of the most common functionals are implemented,
including several flavours of map and fold.</p></li>
<li><p>A new control statement - the <code>Return( )</code> function - can
be used to improve the expressiveness of functional code.</p></li>
<li><p>Partial application and function composition are encouraged
as standard operations.</p></li>
