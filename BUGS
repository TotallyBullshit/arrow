Issue number #9
### Todo:

- [ ] #3 testthat issue: expect_equal(xSplit('.', 'ab'), c('a', 'b'))
- [ ] #5 possible issue in functions using vapply; names are sometimes preserved. Check every function, then close issue.
- [ ] #8 replace the parameter name 'f' with something more descriptive (closure?).

### Done:

- [x] #1 xLines and related function '' == character(0)? This may be wrong.
- [x] #2 bug in xSubstring('', 1); returns "NA", not error.
- [x] #6 make number functions generic, and operate on lists/pairlists of numbers too.
- [x] #7 ensure all function that take a collection/vector take a list or pairlist of length-one elements.
- [x] #4 xRest's type signature should include non-list collections.
