Todo:

- [ ] #3 testthat issue: expect_equal(xSplit('.', 'ab'), c('a', 'b'))
- [ ] #4 xRest's type signature should include non-list collections.
- [ ] #5 possible issue in functions using vapply; names are sometimes preserved. Check every function, then close issue.

Done:

- [x] #1 "xLines and related function '' == character(0)? This may be wrong."
- [x] #2 bug in xSubstring('', 1); returns "NA", not error.
